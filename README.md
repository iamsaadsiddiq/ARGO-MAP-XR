# ARGO MAP XR — The Intelligent Dashboard for Human Space Exploration  

## Overview  

ARGO MAP XR is a unified artificial intelligence–powered research and visualization platform designed to help scientists, mission planners, and researchers explore NASA’s bioscience data in an entirely new way.  
It summarizes, visualizes, and simulates key insights from over 600 NASA publications on human, plant, and microbial life in space.  
The project integrates AI, machine learning, and knowledge graph technologies to create an interactive experience that enables users to analyze biological responses in microgravity, forecast mission outcomes, and visualize real-time space environments.

## Key Features  

### 1. AI Research Analyzer  
- Upload NASA bioscience CSV datasets.  
- Automatic data cleaning and entity extraction using transformer models (BERT-based).  
- Semantic query system to find studies, for example: *“Show me research about radiation effects on human bones.”*  
- Trend visualizations, radar plots, and word clouds generated automatically.  

### 2. Knowledge Graph Explorer  
- Fully interactive research network built using PyVis.  
- Nodes grouped by study type (human, plant, microbial).  
- Click any node to open a paper summary or related metadata.  

### 3. 3D Space Simulation Dashboard  
- Real-time solar system model created with Plotly 3D.  
- Displays trajectories of the ISS, Moon, and Mars.  
- Includes simulations of orbital velocity, radiation exposure, and time dilation.  

### 4. Predictive Analytics and Forecasting  
- Predicts mission success probabilities using historical biological and environmental data.  
- Models space radiation impact and crew health index through machine learning.  

### 5. Visualization Suite  
- 2D, 3D, and animated graphs for every biological and environmental variable.  
- Heatmaps for cell mutation rates under radiation exposure.  
- Dynamic dashboards that update in real time.  

### 6. Human Digital Twin  
- Embedded 3D human model that simulates physiological responses in zero gravity.  
- Adjustable variables: oxygen level, radiation, bone/muscle mass.  

### 7. AI-Powered Report Generator  
- Generates structured PDF reports with UTF-8 encoding (no Unicode errors).  
- Multilingual summaries and automatically generated timestamps.  

### 8. NASA API Integration  
- Connects to NASA OSDR, Space Life Sciences Library, and NASA Task Book.  
- Fetches real-time experiment metadata and publications.  

### 9. Immersive User Interface  
- Streamlit and Three.js integration for a live 3D space background.  
- Rotating galaxies, parallax Moon/Mars layers, and astronaut reflections.  
- Responsive layout with modern design principles.

## How It Works

1. **User uploads NASA bioscience data.**
   The system preprocesses and cleans the dataset.

2. **AI model extracts insights.**
   Transformer-based text mining identifies patterns and correlations.

3. **Knowledge Graph visualizes relationships.**
   Research nodes are dynamically mapped and made interactive.

4. **3D simulation shows space and biology dynamics.**
   Live solar trajectories, radiation exposure, and physical responses are animated.

5. **Predictions and reports generated.**
   The app produces analytics and exportable PDF summaries automatically.

## Example Outputs

* Interactive knowledge graph of 600+ publications.
* 3D visualization of ISS and Mars trajectories.
* Predictive analytics for radiation impact on biological growth.
* Human body digital twin showing zero-G simulation effects.
* Automatically generated AI summaries and downloadable reports.

## Future Enhancements

* Integration of FAISS-based semantic retrieval for large dataset queries.
* Addition of voice-activated search commands.
* Real-time 3D collaborative VR mode for multi-user interaction.
* Automated narrative generator using a small LLM for storytelling.

Would you like me to also generate the **`requirements.txt` and Dockerfile** so that anyone can instantly deploy it from this README (either locally or on Streamlit Cloud)?  
That would make the project “clone → run” ready for global submission.
